# ece350_finalProject

The final project for the ECE 350 Digital Systems course at Duke University. Our project is a video game programmed in a MIPS-like ISA that runs on custom designed hardware. 

* The code for the final iteration of the game is in the file FinalBlockBlitz.s
* The folder skel_new_THEREEEEEALONE contains all the hardware components implemented in VERILOG, including a processor, processor sub-modules like an ALU, multiplier, divider, and register file, as well as modules to handle I/O using the VGA and keyboard. 
* For the final project, we deployed our hardware on a DE2 FPGA and loaded the program in FinalBlockBlitz.s onto the FPGA as well. 
* The following link shows a brief demo of our game deployed on the FPGA with VGA and keyboard attached: https://youtu.be/PRwGxOuPOH0
